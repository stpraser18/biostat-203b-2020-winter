## Q1. Git/GitHub

**No handwritten homework reports are accepted for this course.** We work with Git and GitHub. Efficient and abundant use of Git, e.g., frequent and well-documented commits, is an important criterion for grading your homework.

1. Apply for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) at GitHub using your UCLA email.

2. Create a **private** repository `biostat-203b-2020-winter` and add `Hua-Zhou` and `juhkim111` as your collaborators with write permission.

3. Top directories of the repository should be `hw1`, `hw2`, ... Maintain two branches `master` and `develop`. The `develop` branch will be your main playground, the place where you develop solution (code) to homework problems and write up report. The `master` branch will be your presentation area. Submit your homework files (R markdown file `Rmd`, `html` file converted from R markdown, all code and data sets to reproduce results) in `master` branch.

4. After each homework due date, teaching assistant and instructor will check out your master branch for grading. Tag each of your homework submissions with tag names `hw1`, `hw2`, ... Tagging time will be used as your submission time. That means if you tag your `hw1` submission after deadline, penalty points will be deducted for late submission.

**Solution**: I have created this repository.

## Q2. Linux Shell Commands

1. This exercise (and later in this course) uses the [MIMIC-III data](https://mimic.physionet.org), a freely accessible critical care database developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology. Please follow the instructions at <https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/> to complete the CITI `Data or Specimens Only Research` course. Show the screenshot of your completion report. 

**Solution:** Here is a screenshot of my completion report.

</p>

2. The `/home/203bdata/mimic-iii/` folder on teaching server contains data sets from MIMIC-III. See <https://mimic.physionet.org/mimictables/admissions/> for details of each table.  
    ```{bash, eval=TRUE}
    ls -l /home/203bdata/mimic-iii
    ```
Please, do **not** put these data files into Git; they are big. Also do **not** copy them into your directory. Just read from the data folder `/home/203bdata/mimic-iii` directly in following exercises. 

    Use Bash commands to answer following questions.

3. What's the output of following bash script?
    ```{bash, eval=TRUE}
    for datafile in /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/*.csv
      do
        ls $datafile
      done
    ```

Display the number of lines in each `csv` file.

**Solution:**To display the number of lines in each 'csv' file
  ```{bash}
    for datafile in /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/*.csv
      do
        wc -l $datafile
      done
  ```

4. Display the first few lines of `ADMISSIONS.csv`. How many rows are in this data file? How many unique patients (identified by `SUBJECT_ID`) are in this data file? What are the possible values taken by each of the variable `INSURANCE`, `LANGUAGE`, `RELIGION`, `MARITAL_STATUS`, and `ETHNICITY`? How many (unique) patients are Hispanic? (Hint: combine Linux comamnds `head`, `tail`, `awk`, `uniq`, `wc`, `sort` and so on using pipe.)

**Solution:** Let's display the first 10 lines of `ADMISSIONS.csv`
```{bash, eval=TRUE}
head /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv
```
**Solution:** Number of lines for ADMISSIONS file is 58977

```{bash, eval=TRUE}
awk 'END { print NR }' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv
```

**Solution:** Sort unique values of insurance - government, medicaid, medicare, private, self pay.
```{bash, eval=TRUE}
awk -F, '{ print $10 }' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | tail -n+2 | sort -u
```

**Solution:** Languages spoken sorted
```{bash, eval=TRUE}
awk -F, '{ print $11 }' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | tail -n+2 | sort -u
```


**Solution:** Values for religion

```{bash, eval=TRUE}
awk -F, '{ print $12 }' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | tail -n+2 | sort -u
```

**Solution:** Marital status sorted
```{bash, eval=TRUE}
awk -F, '{ print $13 }' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | tail -n+2 | sort -u
```

**Solution:** Ethnicity sorted
```{bash, eval=TRUE}
awk -F, '{ print $14 }' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | tail -n+2 | sort -u
```

**Solution:** There are 58,768 unique patients in the admissions data file.
``` {bash, eval=TRUE}
cut -d ',' -f2 /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | sort -u | wc -l
```


**Solution:** There are 2128 amount of Hispanics.

```{bash, eval=TRUE}
grep 'HISPANIC' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | sort -u | wc -l
```


## Q3. More fun with shell

1. You and your friend just have finished reading *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen. Among the four main characters in the book, Elizabeth, Jane, Lydia, and Darcy, your friend thinks that Darcy was the most mentioned. You, however, are certain it was Elizabeth. Obtain the full text of the novel from <http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/42671/pg42671.txt> and save to your local folder. 

```{bash, eval=TRUE}
    curl http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/42671/pg42671.txt > pride_and_prejudice.txt
```
 
Do **not** put this text file `pride_and_prejudice.txt` in Git. Using a `for` loop, how would you tabulate the number of times each of the four characters is mentioned?

```{bash eval=TRUE}
for name in Elizabeth Jane Lydia Darcy
      do grep -o -i $name pride_and_prejudice.txt | wc -l
     done
```


0. What's the difference between the following two commands?
    ```{bash eval=FALSE}
    echo 'hello, world' > test1.txt
    ```
    and
    ```{bash eval=FALSE}
    echo 'hello, world' >> test2.txt
    ```
**Solution:** The echo command displays the line of text, creating the phrase onto a text file.There is no difference between the two commands since both text files contained the phrase "hello, world", except >> will append the output from one command to the text file, the > directs the output from one command to a file.

0. Using your favorite text editor (e.g., `vi`), type the following and save the file as `middle.sh`:


```{bash eval=FALSE}
    #!/bin/sh
    # Select lines from the middle of a file.
    # Usage: bash middle.sh filename end_line num_lines
    head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"
```

Using `chmod` make the file executable by the owner, and run 
```{bash eval=TRUE}
    ./middle.sh pride_and_prejudice.txt 20 5
```
Explain the output. Explain the meaning of `"$1"`, `"$2"`, and `"$3"` in this shell script. Why do we need the first line of the shell script?

**Solution:** The last command will print five lines. The head -n is reading the beginning lines two lines indicated by $1 and $2, which is a blank row and then author. The $3 tail reads the last three lines from the bottom.The first line of the shell script is necessary to ensure that the "sh" as the parent to execute any further commands.

**Output:** Author: Jane Austen

## Q4. R Batch Run

In class we discussed using R to organize simulation studies. 

1. Expand the [`runSim.R`](https://ucla-biostat203b-2020winter.github.io/slides/02-linux/runSim.R) script to include arguments `seed` (random seed), `n` (sample size), `dist` (distribution) and `rep` (number of simulation replicates). When `dist="gaussian"`, generate data from standard normal; when `dist="t1"`, generate data from t-distribution with degree of freedom 1 (same as Cauchy distribution); when `dist="t5"`, generate data from t-distribution with degree of freedom 5. Calling `runSim.R` will (1) set random seed according to argument `seed`, (2) generate data according to argument `dist`, (3) compute the primed-indexed average estimator and the classical sample average estimator for each simulation replicate, (4) report the average mean squared error (MSE)
$$
  \frac{\sum_{r=1}^{\text{rep}} (\widehat \mu_r - \mu_{\text{true}})^2}{\text{rep}}
$$
for both methods.

**Solution:** This is my `runSim.R` code:

```{bash}
cat runSim.R
```


**Solution:** The prime average is 0.039 and the sample average is 0.011.

2. Modify the [`autoSim.R`](https://ucla-biostat203b-2020winter.github.io/slides/02-linux/autoSim.R) script to run simulations with combinations of sample sizes `nVals = seq(100, 500, by=100)` and distributions `distTypes = c("gaussian", "t1", "t5")` and write output to appropriately named files. Use `rep = 50`, and `seed = 203`. 

```{bash, eval=TRUE}
cat autoSim.R
```

**Solution:** All the files were created according to sample size and distribution.

3. Write an R script to collect simulation results from output files and print average MSEs in a table of format

| $n$ | Method   | Gaussian | $t_5$ | $t_1$ |
|-----|----------|-------|-------|----------|
| 100 | PrimeAvg |       |       |          |
| 100 | SampAvg  |       |       |          |
| 200 | PrimeAvg |       |       |          |
| 200 | SampAvg  |       |       |          |
| 300 | PrimeAvg |       |       |          |
| 300 | SampAvg  |       |       |          |
| 400 | PrimeAvg |       |       |          |
| 400 | SampAvg  |       |       |          |
| 500 | PrimeAvg |       |       |          |
| 500 | SampAvg  |       |       |          |

```{bash}
cat MSEtable.R
```
